# ORBITO
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A satellite tracker with two functions. It either tracks the most popular satellites, or any satellite within the closest proximity to Saxion (Sorted by closest to furthest). Satellite with name "`JWST`" does **not** have broken lat., lon., & alt. readings - it is within a halo orbit within a Sun-Earth lagrange, so it just isn't "*present*" around Earth. Pointless to track it, but the developer thought it was a cool little piece of information.

### WHEN INSTALLING
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing much has to be done other than extracting the files into a folder. A shortcut should be present that points to the main `.exe` file within the `bin` folder. Otherwise, find the `.exe` within `RWI491775_Assessment_SATELLITES` -> `bin` -> `Debug` -> `net6.0` -> Scroll down until you find a Type ***application***.
&nbsp;
### ENJOY
Plenty of satellites can be found within the *Nearby Saxion* list. Each include name, ID (NORAD), and current distance. This can be used for viewing (astronomy!) or simply Googling fun-facts about them. Wishing the best, from yours truly. :)
